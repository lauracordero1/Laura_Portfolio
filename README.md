My academic projects in C

# [Project 1: Mario: Project Overview](https://github.com/code50/98297122/blob/68bcdea80e02ca0ed9bf4b15f7dce6fdb2328af5/mario-less/mario.c)
Created a tool that based of user input printed out a pyramid using hashes (#) for bricks. Each hash is a bit taller than it is wide, so the pyramid itself is also be taller than it is wide. 

# [Project 2: Cash: Project Overview](https://github.com/code50/98297122/blob/071c712947fc2e90930d601908e232c6591c0796/cash/cash.c)

# [Project 3: Redability: Project Overview](https://github.com/code50/98297122/blob/c244fa51dbc85016e3feb1248d5e6d8f605a9e14/readability/readability.c#L29)
Wrote a program that determines the reading level of the inputed text based of the Coleman-Liau index. The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output that (U.S.) grade level that is needed to understand some text.  

# [Project 4: Ceasar: Project Overview](https://github.com/code50/98297122/blob/7606698ae79a97575f42dafe129aacac3dee645f/caesar/caesar.c)
Wrote a program that enables the user to encrypt messages using Caesar’s cipher. At the time the user executes the program, they should decide, by providing a command-line argument, what the key should be in the secret message they’ll provide at runtime. We shouldn’t necessarily assume that the user’s key is going to be a number; though it may be assumed that, if it is a number, it will be a positive integer.

# [Project 5: Scrabble: Project Overview](https://github.com/code50/98297122/blob/9e58667682ba2362049557b028d01af99ed0b8aa/scrabble/scrabble.c)
Wrote a program that determines the winner of a short scrabble-like game, where two players each enter their word, and the higher scoring player wins.

# [Project 6: Grocery Store: Project Overview](https://github.com/code50/98297122/blob/b84d8365cad02eda373bedac4bd6cc39beba684f/grocery_store/grocery_store.c#L17)
Wrote a program that displays basic information such as the price, item location, and average customer review for a specific inventory item within a grocery store.

# [Project 7: Grocery Store Part 2: Project Overview](https://github.com/code50/98297122/blob/571f34e0d370a536a73a5d3c19d4e501efa3fefe/grocery_store2/grocery_store2.c#L23)
Further elaborated the first grocery store project to allow for the modification of a sales price and the customer review. The improved tool now also allows for the calculation of the impact each day of the week has on the sale of the product.

# [Project 8: Data and Switches: Project Overview](https://github.com/code50/98297122/blob/fa6818828aa46ce25322e2ea36620d450a1cc506/dates_switches/dates_switches.c#L71)
Created a tool that converts inputed dates from MM/DD/YY display to a Month D, Yr display.

# [Project 9: Fizz Buzz: Project Overview](https://github.com/code50/98297122/blob/4f68da777ecac4fb67799139505e22b21e59d080/fizz_buzz/fizz_buzz.c#L29)
Wrote a program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of 5, print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.

# [Project 10: Anagram Finder: Project Overview](https://github.com/code50/98297122/blob/e159cbfebd0e0c02a3fc0c645160afc108726d04/anagram_finder/anagram_finder.c#L61)
Wrote a program that determines whether two strings are anagrams or not.

# [Project 11: String Copier: Project Overview](https://github.com/code50/98297122/blob/ab1b1cfcfa79c6952c5072fd26b154d890c92a5b/string_copier/string_copier.c#L22)
Wrote a program to practice copying the contents of a source string into a destination string.

# [Project 12: Mini Calendar: Project Overview](https://github.com/code50/98297122/blob/66f9803704af8daef96ea2f93ce07fa5ca72fb76/mini_calendar/mini_calendar.c#L58)
The goal of the program was to create a system that could add dates to any given date taking into consideration leap years and print out the new date.

# [Project 13: Race Simulator: Project Overview](https://github.com/code50/98297122/blob/cccf37207cc51abea7424334cda1eb813e18d9ee/race_simulator/race_simulator.c#L39)
The goal of the project was to create a program that would print out results based on a simulated and randomized race.
